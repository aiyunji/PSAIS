# PSAIS
Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence Assisted Prenatal Ultrasonography Screening System for Trainees

# Prerequisites

We use a modified version of the darknet from https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet to detect the ultrasound structures on the real-time video stream.  This is easy to install and train followed the original darknet project.

# Background 
Fetal anomaly screening via ultrasonography, involving capturing and interpreting standard views, is highly challenging for inexperienced operators. To develop and validate a prenatal-screening artificial intelligence system (PSAIS) for real-time evaluation of the quality of anatomical images, indicating existing and missing structures, and to explore its potential role in training sonographers.
